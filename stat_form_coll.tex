\begin{equation}
\label{frequency distributions}
\end{equation}
\footnotesize Constructing frequency distributions where k is the smallest number of classes and n the number of observations:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item decide on the number of classes k where \(2^k > n\)
 \item  determine the class interval i by \(i\geq\frac{\text{max value - min value}}{k}\)
 \item set individual class limits.
 \item tally the values into the classes.
 \item count the number of items in each class.
\end{enumerate}
\hformbar


\formdesc{Population mean (raw data)}
\begin{equation}
\label{population mean raw data}

\end{equation}
where:

\item $n$ denotes the number of values in the sample.
\item $x$ denotes any value.
\end{itemize}
\hformbar


\formdesc{median}
\begin{equation}
\label{median}
\end{equation}
The midpoint of the values after they have been ordered from the minimum to the maximum values. The data must be at least an ordinal level of measurement.
\hformbar


\formdesc{mode}
\begin{equation}
\label{mode}
\end{equation}
The value of the observation that appears most frequently. It is especially useful in summarizing ordinal level data.

\formdesc{Geometric mean}
\begin{equation}
\label{geometric mean}
\text{Geometric mean} = \sqrt[n]{(x_{1})(x_{2}) \cdots (x_{n})}
\end{equation}
Note:\\ 
Useful in finding the \emph{average change} -- in contrast to equation \eqref{rate of increase over time} -- of percentages, ratios, indices or growth rates over time. The geometric mean will always be less than or equal (never more than) the arithmetic mean. Also, all the data values must be \emph{positive}.

\textrm{Note:} The population standard deviation $\sigma$ in essence mitigates the dilemma of a single sample (ref. \eqref{population variance} . In the first sample the deviation between observed value $x$ and the population mean $\mu$ might differ to a great extent, in a second sample the deviation might well be very different again.

\begin{itemize}
 \item $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.
 \item $x$  is the value of a particular observation in the population.
 \item $\mu$ is the arithmetic mean of the population.

\label{chebyshev's Theorem}
\end{equation}\textbf{Chebyshev's Theorem}\\

\hformbar


\formdesc{Arithmetic mean of grouped data}
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}
where:

z = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
\end{equation}
Notice an important difference to equation \eqref{standard normal value}. Whereas equation \eqref{standard normal value} uses the random variable $x$, the population mean $\mu$, and the population standard deviation $\sigma$, this formula is used in cases where the research refers to a \textbf{sample rather than to just one observation}.

where: 
\begin{itemize}

\sigma^{2}_{\bar{x_{1}}-\bar{x_{2}}} = \frac{\sigma^{2}_{1}}{n_{1}} + \frac{\sigma^{2}_{2}}{n_{2}}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\sigma^{2}_{\bar{x_{1}}-\bar{x_{2}}}$ is variance of the differences in means.
 \item $\bar{x}_{1}$ and $\bar{x}_{2}$ are the sample means of the first and second sample, respectively.
 \item $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are the sample sizes.
\end{itemize}
\hformbar


\formdesc{Two-Sample Test -- Test of Means ($\sigma$ Known)}
\begin{equation}
\label{two-sample test of means sigma known}
z = \frac{\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{2}_{1}}{{n}_{1}}+\frac{{\sigma}^{2}_{2}}{n_{2}}}}
\end{equation}
Note: above formula refers to formula \eqref{pooled variance}. Using it stipulates the following\footnote{Lind et al., p. 351}:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item the sampled populations are approximately normally distributed.
 \item the sampled populations are independent.
 \item the standard deviations of the two populations are \textbf{known}.
\end{enumerate}
where: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item $z$ refers to the standard value.
 \item $\bar{x}$ refers for the sample mean.
 \item $\sigma^{2}$ refers to the population variance.
 \item $n$ refers to the sample size. 
\end{itemize}
\hformbar


\formdesc{Two-Sample Test -- Pooled Variance ($\sigma$ Unknown)}
\begin{equation}
\label{pooled variance}
s^{2}_{p} = \frac{(n_{1} - 1)s^{2}_{1} + (n_{2}-1)s^{2}_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2} -2}
\end{equation}
Note: using the pooled variance formula assumes following important assumptions for the test.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item the sampled populations are approximately normally distributed.
 \item the sampled populations are independent.
 \item the standard deviations of the two populations are \textbf{equal}.
\end{enumerate}
In essence, the formula computes a weighted mean of the two sample standard deviations using the degrees of freedom that each sample provides. The resulting value serves then as an estimate for the unknown population standard deviation. The reason for pooling arises from the assumption that the two populations have \emph{equal standard deviations} and best estimate we can make of that value is to combine or pool all the sample information we have about the value of the population standard deviation. In contrast, formula \eqref{paired t test} assumes related or \emph{paired} samples. If such an assumption is reasonable the resulting hypothesis test is much more sensitive to detecting a significant difference than a hypothesis test based on independent samples compared to independent samples since we are able to \emph{reduce the variation} in the sampling distribution\footnote{Lind et al., p. 368}.

where:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $s^{2}_{p}$ is pooled variance. Further used in equation \eqref{two-sample test of means sigma unknown} due to the assumption in that the two populations sampled have the same standard deviations.
 \item $s^{2}_{1}$ is the variance of the first sample.
 \item $s^{2}_{2}$ is the variance of the second sample.
 \item $n_{1}$ is the sample size of the first sample.
 \item $n_{2}$ is the sample size of the second sample.
 \item $n_{1}+n_{2}-2$ is the degree of freedom usually denoted as $df$.
\end{itemize} 
\hformbar


\formdesc{Two-Sample Test -- Test of Means ($\sigma$ Unknown)}
\begin{equation}
\label{two-sample test of means sigma unknown}
t = \frac{\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}}{\sqrt{s^{2}_{p}(\frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}})}}
\end{equation}
Note: the pooled variance $s^{2}_{p}$ is to be computed using equation \eqref{pooled variance} beforehand. Therefore the same prerequisite applies here:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item the sampled populations are approximately normally distributed.
 \item the sampled populations are independent.
 \item the standard deviations of the two populations are \textbf{equal}.
\end{enumerate}

Note: the \textbf{Wilcoxon rank-sum test} (ref. formula \eqref{wilcoxon rank sum test}) is an alternative to the Two-Sample t test. While the Two-Sample t test requires two populations follow the normal distribution and have equal population variances, these prerequisites \textbf{do not} apply for the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

where:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\bar{x}_{1}$ is the mean of the first sample.
 \item $\bar{x}_{2}$ is the mean of the second sample.
 \item $n_{1}$ is the number of observations in the first sample. 
 \item $n_{2}$ is the number of observations in the second sample.
 \item $s^{2}_{p}$ is the pooled estimate of the population variance.
\end{itemize}

\formdesc{Two-Sample Test -- Test Statistic for No Difference in Means, Unequal Variances ($\sigma$ Unknown)}

t = \frac{\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}}{\sqrt{\frac{s^{2}_{1}}{n_{1}}+\frac{s^{2}_{2}}{n_{2}}}}
\end{equation}
Note: this equation differs only in one aspect from equation \eqref{two-sample test of means sigma unknown} in that the pooled variance $s^{2}_{p}$ could be used due to the assumption that both sample variances are equal. Since this formula assumes that both sample variances are \textbf{unequal} the denominator now splits into two components using $s^{2}_1{}$ and $s^{2}_{2}$ as variances.

where:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\bar{x}_{1}$ is the mean of the first sample.
 \item $\bar{x}_{2}$ is the mean of the second sample.
 \item $s^{2}_{1}$ is sample variance of the first sample.
 \item $s^{2}_{2}$ is sample variance of the second sample.
 \item $n_{1}$ is the number of observations in the first sample. 
 \item $n_{2}$ is the number of observations in the second sample.

\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $df$ is the degree of freedom.
 \item $s^{2}_{1}$ is sample variance of the first sample.
 \item $s^{2}_{2}$ is sample variance of the second sample.

where:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\bar{d}$ is the mean of the difference between the paired or related observations.
 \item $s_{d}$ is the standard deviation of the differences between the paired or related observations.
 \item $n$ is the number of paired observations.
\end{itemize}
\hformbar


\formdesc{Two-Sample Test -- Paired $t$ Test}
\begin{equation}
\label{paired t test}
t = \frac{\bar{d}}{\frac{s_{d}}{\sqrt{n}}}
\end{equation}
Note: whereas formula \eqref{pooled variance} assumes independent samples and thus incurs a much greater variation through the process of pooling, tests from paired samples allow to greatly reduce the variation from the sampling distribution. Also note the possible disadvantage that the degrees of freedom for paired samples are usually lower than their independent counterparts\footnote{Lind et al., p. 369}.

Note: An alternative to test with \emph{dependent samples} is the \textbf{Wilcoxon signed-rank test}. For this test the normality assumption is not required.

There are $n-1$ degrees of freedom and
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\bar{d}$ is the mean of the difference between  the paired or related observations.
 \item $s_{d}$ is the standard deviation of the differences between the paired of related observations.
 \item $n$ is the number of paired observations.

 \item $s^{2}_{1}$ is the sample variance of the second sample.
 \item $F$ represents the F distribution.
\end{itemize}
If the null hypothesis is true, the test statistic follows the $F$ distribution with $n_{1}-1$ and $n_{2}-1$ degrees of freedom.

In ANOVA the critical value of the F statistic decides whether the null hypothesis $H_{0}$ can be rejected.

If these assumptions are not reasonable the \textbf{Kruskal-Wallis} nonparametric test as in formula \eqref{kruskal wallis test} is advisable.

\textsc{Subject:} this test is specifically designed to determine whether two \emph{independent samples} came

Note: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Advantage: simple price indices are not dependent on the unit of measure of the item quantified.
 \item Disadvantage: simple price indices do not the account for the relative importance of the items included.

where:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $P$ is the price index.
